    	<h2>HISTORY OF THE COLOSSEUM</h2>
    	<p>The building of the Colosseum, also called the Flavian Amphitheater, started in 72 AD under Emperor Vespasian. It was inaugurated 8 years later by Vespasian’s son, Titus, although the construction work was finished two years later.<br>The Roman Colosseum could hold 50,000 – 80,000 people during the era of the Roman Empire. Along with gladiatorial contests, the Colosseum also hosted other events. Anything that entertained the Emperor, the elites and the common people was held here including classical drama, sporting events, executions, hunts, and wild animal fights.<br>The Colosseum served as Rome’s entertainment center for around 450 years. The fall of the Roman Empire, as well as changing public tastes, brought an end to the gladiatorial fights and other public shows by the 6th century. By then, the Colosseum itself had been damaged due to natural phenomena like earthquakes and lightning.<br>In the centuries that followed, the arena was completely abandoned, and its materials were used to build many projects, such as the Basilica of St. John Lateran, St. Peter’s Cathedral, the defence fortifications along River Tiber and the Palazzo Venezia.<br>But starting in the early 18th century, popes began to consider conserving the monument as a holy Christian site. Although it should be noted that it is uncertain whether any early Christians had actually been killed in the Colosseum.<br>By the 1900s, a combination of neglect, vandalism, weather and natural disasters had damaged almost two-thirds of the original building, including all of its marble seats and decor. Restoration efforts started in the same period and have continued since.
