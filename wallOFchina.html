				<h1>Great Wall of China</h1>

		<div class="a-wall-info">
				<p>Coiling its way through 23 degrees of longitude, the Great Wall (长城, Chángchéng) stands as an awe-inspiring monument to the grandeur of China’s ancient history. With sections dating back 2000 years, the wall (or, more accurately, walls, because they belong to several different eras) wriggle haphazardly from their scattered Manchurian remains in Liaoning province to wind-scoured rubble in the Gobi desert and faint traces in the unforgiving sands of Xinjiang. Interspersed with natural defences (such as precipitous mountains), the Great Wall can be visited in 15 Chinese provinces, principalities and autonomous regions, but nowhere is better than Beijing for mounting your assault on this most iconic of bastions.</p>

				<h2>Which Section of Great Wall to Visit</h2>
				<p>The official survey by the National Cultural Heritage Administration of China reveals that Inner Mongolia, Hebei, and Shanxi are the top three regions boasting the most Great Wall relics. The walls, crossing 26 degrees of longitude, and not machine-made, appear in totally diversified status and sceneries. Generally the walls in east China are kept in good condition, while those in the wild northwest have been heavily weathered or damaged.</p>
				<br>
				<p>
				Beijing, owning only 5.38% of all the wall relics throughout China, has the quintessence of the Ming Great Wall. The best-preserved and most-visited sections are generally within 130 km north of downtown Beijing.</p>

				<ul>
					<li>First-time visitors to Beijing: Badaling, or Mutianyu</li>
					<li>Return visitors: Juyongguan, or Simatai (with Gubei Water Town)</li>
					<li>Experienced hikers: Jiankou (wild and dangerous)</li>
					<li>Best sections out of Beijing: Shanhaiguan in Hebei, Jiayuguan in Gansu, Zhenbeitai in Shaanxi</li>

						<p>For first-time visitors to China, Badaling with the most representative Great Wall and the highest popularity is your first choice. Climb up to find the ‘Ture Hero’ tablet inscribed by Chairman Mao, and do not miss the museum at the foot of the mountain, which specializes in Great Wall’s history, construction, military use, and conservation status.</p><br>
